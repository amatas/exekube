# What problem does Exekube solve?

**Problem definition:** we have some kind of task that would require cloud resources (compute, network or storage) to be completed successfully.

!!! note
We presume that we operate at a scale or money is not much of a problem.

We must therefore use the API of a cloud platform, like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure (the "big three" of enterprise cloud providers). Therefore, we are in need of communicating our tasks to a cloud provider. The only way to do it is though their API.
